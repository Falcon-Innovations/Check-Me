## Prerequisites to contribute

- Read through
  ["JavaScript to Know for React"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- Install the React DevTools
  ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
  (recommended),
  [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))


## Quick start

It's recommended you run everything in the same environment you work in every
day, but if you don't want to set up the repository locally, you can get started
in one click with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io),
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals), or
by following the [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCoVJm3hGk4)
instructions for [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals)

For a local development environment, follow the instructions below

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `14 || 16 || 18`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].


```shell
git clone  https://github.com/Falcon-Innovations/Check-Me.git
cd check-me app
expo start
```


If you are still unable to fix issues and you know how to use Docker 🐳 you can
setup the project with the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
expo start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.
