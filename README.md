  <strong>
    An application that helps ladies check their breast for breast cancer.
  </strong>
  <p>
    Founded by Falcon Innovation. This project was designed to counterbalance the ravishing effects of breast cancer. The application is designed to be as simple as possible, and to be easy to use.

  <h3>
  Problem statement and summary
  </h3>
  <p>
  Women need attention along the breast care pathway depending on their personal risk profile. Every female seven to ten days after menstruation is supposed to conduct a breast
self-examination to look for abnormal nodules, redness, fluid coming from the nipples, and orange skin appearance on the breast to ensure she is not at risk or has developed breast cancer.
Breast cancer can be treated if noticed at an early stage. Most often, these symptoms are
neglected by the victims and are left to escalate leading to more damage. Breast Cancer is
the most diagnosed cancer in women, and has led to the death of many women. According to the latest WHO data published in 2018 Breast Cancer Deaths in Cameroon reached 1,400 or 0.67% of total deaths. The age-adjusted Death Rate is 20.15 per 100,000 population which ranks Cameroon number 45 in the world.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Innovative Solution</h3>
  <p>What the women need is software that can continuously sensitize them to the symptoms,
causes, and treatment of breast cancer and alert them to go to a hospital when need be. This initiative I want to build would not only serve as a canary for everything that concerns breast cancer but will also act as a nudge for every woman and young girl to do a breast
self-examination frequently. The Breast cancer app will be designed to allow individuals to
self-monitor for early signs of breast cancer. The application will help identify if further medical screening is required by providing monthly inputs on breast irregularities. My goal is to make this app very accessible to all its users regardless of their age, the language of communication, and geographical location. I intend to create a network with doctors in my community that screen and treat breast cancer. This way, users will find it easy to get to them if need be.

## Prerequisites to contribute

- Read through
  ["JavaScript to Know for React"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- Install the React DevTools
  ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
  (recommended),
  [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))


## Quick start

It's recommended you run everything in the same environment you work in every
day, but if you don't want to set up the repository locally, you can get started
in one click with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io),
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals), or
by following the [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCoVJm3hGk4)
instructions for [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals)

For a local development environment, follow the instructions below

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `14 || 16 || 18`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].


```shell
git clone  https://github.com/Falcon-Innovations/Check-Me.git
cd check-me app
expo start
```


If you are still unable to fix issues and you know how to use Docker 🐳 you can
setup the project with the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
expo start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.
